# Efficient dynamic LIS algorithms

üèÜ Competitive assignment.  
I developed the following algorithms for a competitive assignment at my university.  
I wrote the algorithms I attached here in a way that is a little clearer to understand,
but it is certainly possible to optimize the runtimes of the algorithms.  

<b>Note</b> that for each algorithm I created an animated image that illustrates the implementation.  
(The movement of the frames in the animation is relatively slow for the purpose of tracking each step).   

The algorithms work on input of numbers so that each number has a single instance (no repetitions).   
Challenge: modify the algorithms to work for input of numbers with repeats    
(e.g the input: {1, 2, 13, 2} where the number 2 repeats twice).

<h2>Calculate the number (and length) of LIS</h2>
<b>Complexity: nlog(n).</b>

-----

By dynamic programming, it is possible to calculate the length and number of LIS in the complexity of nlog(n).  
After performing the pseudo-code attached below we will conclude:  
LIS length = number of rows.  
LIS number = the 'sum' variable in the last element (the last element in the last row).

<b>Note!</b> Only 'sum' variable is needed for this implementation!  
'count' and 'child index' variables are used only for the output of all LIS as shown below.  

<b>Sum</b>  - represents the sum of LIS till this node.  
<b>Count</b>  - represents the number of LIS such that this node is the last number.  
<b>Child index</b>  - represents the index of the first child of this node.  

```diff
pseudo-code:
‚Ä¢ perform binary search on last
   elements on each row.
‚Ä¢ add the new element to the row.
‚Ä¢ perform binary search on the previous row
   first child index =
  (+) founded index + 1.
‚Ä¢ new element sum =
  (+) sum of the last element on the previous row
  (-) sum of the element left to first child 
  (+) sum of the element left to the new element.
‚Ä¢ new element count =
  (+) new element sum
  (-) sum of the element left to the new element.
```

Therefore, the last element sum is the number of LIS (as marked in red in the image below).  
& the number of rows is the length of the LIS.

<h2>Output all the LIS (to two-dimensional array)</h2>
<b>Total Complexity: nlog(n) + sumOfLIS * lengthOfLIS.</b>

<b>Complexity after running the above algorithm: sumOfLIS * lengthOfLIS.</b>

-----

As we mentioned above in the algorithm above we have already calculated the variables 'count' and 'child index' for the purpose of the current algorithm.  

<b>Count</b>  - represents the number of LIS such that this node is the last number.  
<b>Child index</b>  - represents the index of the first child of this node.  

Since for each node, there is a 'count' variable we can always know how many LIS strings there are under the node  
In addition, since for each node, there is a 'child index' variable (by default - the first child), we can always iterate to the child of the node.  
- In each row, the nodes are arranged in ascending order according to the index so if the parent has several LIS strings under him and one of the children has no LIS strings at all under him then we will necessarily have to go to the next child to build the rest of the strings.  
- If during the algorithm we access a certain node whose value has a count = 0, then we necessarily accessed a node through another parent and therefore we will have to restore the 'count' and 'child index' values in order to continue building the strings of the other parent.  

```diff
pseudo-code:
 perform iteration on the last row while element count > 0
 & iterate between each path by child's index

    while element count > 0:
         ‚Ä¢ add num to arr[row][col].
         ‚Ä¢ col = col - 1.
         ‚Ä¢ pointer = pointer child.
         ‚Ä¢ if pointer count = 0:
                restore pointer child index variable.
         ‚Ä¢ pointer count = pointer count - 1.
         ‚Ä¢ if pointer count == 0 & parent count > 0:
                parent child index = parent child index + 1.
         ‚Ä¢ if col == 0:
                add num to arr[row][col].
                col = cols size.
                row = row - 1.
                pointer = head.
                pointer count = pointer count - 1.
    end while
```
